# Mini-Project: Personal Portfolio

## Description

"Mini-Project: Personal Portfolio" uses HTML to create an immersive, dynamic, and relevant personal portfolio tailored for today's software development careers. It showcases my skills as an aspiring software developer in a manner that illustrates such skills.

The portfolio consists of a single webpage divided into "sections", each covering an aspect of my personal, professional, and/or educational background. These sections are, in order:

- **Introduction**: Explaining my mission and what I bring to the table as a professional software developer.
- **About Me**: Covering my professional experience, higher education, career goals, and personal interests.
- **Projects**: Diving in-depth into three coding projects I have built (Contact Management System, Library Management System, and E-commerce API)
- **Skills**: Summarizing my software development skills in a tabular format.
- **Contact**: Displaying a contact form, as well as my email address and link to my LinkedIn profile.
