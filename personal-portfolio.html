                to gain experience in the industry. I am particularly interested in AI within a software development context 
                and how we as developers can harness it to our advantage. I aim to be a part of 
                the new generation of young professionals in the software development field, enhancing companies' 
                ability to create, market, and sell products through elevated, innovative, and efficient business technology.

            <h3>About me</h3>

            <section id="background">
                <h4>Background</h4>

                <p>While I have professed a strong interest in software development since high school, 
                I originally chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in graphic and UX design at Southern New Hampshire University. 
                While progressing in my degree, I worked for Jayde & Rose, a small business which sold handmade crochet art. 
                Additionally, I began building my own small business, Wildest Dreams, designing and selling stickers. 
                Through these experiences, I established a strong foundation of skills in graphic design, web design, 
                user experience, and online marketing, many of which are transferable to software development 
                (e.g., frontend development, SEO, responsive design, typography, and color theory). 
                In total, I have over 2 years of experience in the IT industry.

                <br>
                <br>

                I withdrew from Southern New Hampshire University in March of 2024 with plans to resume my higher education 
                at a later date. Since then, I have been focusing on my passion for software development, 
                having taken a diverse array of courses through Codecademy. From March of 2024 to April of 2024 alone, 
                I completed over 45 hours of coursework through the platform, acquiring many of the technical 
                skills I noted above. However, I intend to continue taking courses through Codecademy, as I am current doing. 
                I am a disciplined, independent learner who is constantly upskilling, sharpening my 
                current skills while simultaneously obtaining new ones.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>For the next year:</b> My main career goal for the next year is to secure an entry-level 
                    remote software development position for a startup whose mission and values align with my own. 
                    I hope to gain experience and credibility within my company as a reliable  member of my team who 
                    prioritizes completing projects in a timely, efficient, and high-quality manner.</li>

                    such as Google or Meta where I can make a six-figure income and have excellent job stability. 
                    Like in the startup, I hope to gain a strong repertoire as a respected individual on my team, 
                    being who my colleagues look to for making pivotal development decisions.</li>

                    <br>
